### Project Description:
* RPG in which you encounter different personas and choose how you want to
develop your relationship with them. You can choose the friendhsip path or the love path for each character. There are different stages of relationships which you can unlock through different actions and reactions. Good luck!
* The stages of relationships will be stored in a stack, ensuring that you cannot proceed to the next stage without completing the current one. Friends will be able to provide advice by "probing" all of the possible paths the user might take and advising accordingly (but beware, friends can be stupid and probe "incorrectly"). We will use sorting algorithms to rank potential love interests based on their (quantified) affection towards the user as the game progresses.
* Launch instructions:
1. Clone this repo.
