### Project Description:
* RPG in which you encounter different personas and choose how you want to  
develop your relationship with them. There are different stages of relationships  
which you can unlock through different actions and reactions. Maybe you'll make  
some friends along the way. Good luck!
* The stages of relationships will be stored in a stack, ensuring that you  
cannot proceed to the next stage without completing the current one. A friend   
will be able to provide advice by "probing" all of the possible paths the user  
might take and advising accordingly (but beware, friends can be stupid and probe  
"incorrectly"). The player will progress through multiple each scenes for each  
stage of the relationship. Each scene is comprised of "trees" of possible  
decisions the player might make, each decision corresponding to a predetermined  
change in the character's attraction to the player.
* Launch instructions:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Launch a terminal session and go to the directory containing Woo.java
3. Run these commands:
   ```
   $ javac Woo.java
   $ java Woo
   ```
* Nota bene unus: Images are only available at the root level because they take up  
too much space.
* Nota bene duo: Any commits attributed to "H. Jeffrey Katz" are from Ariella on her  
dad's computer.
