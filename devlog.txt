OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
wow we so BOSS bc...
We had a class called Character, which was fine until Hugo improved our getting-to-know-you section in the intro (looks for buzzwords and sets up characters' starting attractions accordingly) and had to use a method from Java's og Character class, so we changed our Character class to Charactar to get around it.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
blah blah pesky bug...
maybe some of these will move into the Obs.Ovrcm section...

COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you include "throws <Exception>" in the header of an abstract method of an
 abstract parent class, it must also be included in the header of the method of
 subclass if that method is meant to implement the abstract one.

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
we changed ___ to ___ bc...
In general, many methods and instance variables have been added or removed as we
 continue building out our RPG and realize that certain things might be helpful
 or may have become useless.
We decided to switch from each Character having a single storyline tree to having
 arrays of smaller trees for each stage so that the stage would have greater
 influence on the progression of the relationship

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
tales of wisdom gained...
Copy+paste is your friend but only if you're doing it intentionally
